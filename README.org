Container images bootstrapped with my configs.  The game is simple:

- choose and image
- bootstrap with a few dependencies as possible 
- configure it with ansible

You win if you get emacs to load after running `docker run`
** automated image builds workflow
each directory in this repo is linked to an 'automated' build in
docker hub.  Every push to master triggers a build for each image.
The following things /should/ happen on each push

- latest version of [[https://github.com/vxe/home.git][home]] is pulled
- the latest emacs config is pulled and compiled
