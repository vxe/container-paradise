** SUMMARY
Recap the problem title and/or include more descriptive summary information.

  - What events indicate  a ${1:hardware-availability-configuration-performance} problem?
    $0
  - Has this system ever performed well?

  - What has changed recently? (Software? Hardware? Load?)

** STEPS TO REPRODUCE
  1. Setup or prep work 
    # (metrics, edge report, download logs,tools)
    - 
  2. Include explicit and accurate steps to reproduce. 
    # terminal template + grepping of logs

** RESULTS
Describe your results and how they differed from what you expected.
  # For each item above put a comment on what was expected to happen, use ^ character
    # Aim to be quantitative
    ^ 
** REGRESSION
Provide information on steps taken to isolate the problem. Describe circumstances where the problem occurs or does not occur, such as software versions and/or hardware configurations.

** NOTES
Prove steps to resolve if available, other wise include  references to related problems, leads on diagnosis, screen shots, included attachments, workarounds.
